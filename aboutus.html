Boston Children's stays on top as CHOP slips to 4th in U.S. News' latest ranking
The release also includes top 50 rankings of the best hospitals for those 15 medical specialties.

Among these, the Mayo Clinic picked up top spots in diabetes/endocrinology, gastroenterology/GI surgery, pulmonology/lung surgery and urology. No other facility was named as the top hospital for multiple specialties.

The latest rankings build on previous years’ methodologies with three new ratings on ovarian cancer surgery, prostate cancer surgery and uterine cancer surgery being added to the mix, U.S. News said. Methodology for some ratings tied to specific procedures and conditions also now include home time as a patient-centered outcome, the publication said.

“For patients considering their options for where to get care, the Best Hospitals rankings are designed to help them and their medical professionals identify hospitals that excel in the kind of care they may need,” Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and managing editor at U.S. News, said in a statement accompanying the rankings. “The new cancer ratings provide patients facing surgery for prostate cancer or gynecological cancer with previously unavailable information to assist them in making a critical health care decision.”
